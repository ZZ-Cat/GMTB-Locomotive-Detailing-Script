# GMTB Locomotive Detailing Script
I need to think of a better name for this project. Until I do, you're stuck with this one.

## Description:
 A locomotive detailing script for Garrys Mod Train Build.
 I also need to think of a way better description than that. It's a tad... blunt!

## Features:
 * Automatic Parenting.
   No need to manually parent this E2 to the locomotive's body. It does this all by itself.
 * Automatic updates.
   I took my Self-Updatable E2 script, made a plugin version of it & added it to this script.
   So, whenever I update this project, your versions will get automatically updated too. Yay! =^/,..,^=
 * Multiplayer Lock.
   **NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH OR CONSTRUED AS DRM!** This is merely an anti-griefing measure, for when you're on a train build server.
   Basically, what this does is, it will hide the E2 chip itself & other folk won't be able to dick about with the script work in-server.
   If they want the source code, they can come & get it from here.
   Also, this is a plugin. If you want to exclude Multiplayer Lock from your copy of this script, I've made it easy for you to do so.
 * Smart Entity Discovery.
   The E2 automatically detects whatever it is attached to. If the attached prop is a valid (IE supported) locomotive body blank, then this script will run its course. As an added extra, you don't need to manually spawn in things like bogies, seats & consoles. Because this E2 script does all of that for you.
   Although, currently, only the bogies are automatically spawned in. All of those other things are on the to-do list.

## What's next:
 * Details. Details **GALORE!**
   Over the years, I have been toying with Garrys Mod trains & Expression 2; & I think it's time that I start putting together my own public Expression 2 script, as my personal gift to the Garrys Mod Train Build community - Specifcally, the Flatgrass Construct & Northern Railroad. These folks have been absolutely wonderful in what they do, & I think that this is very well deserved.
   Starting off with "Ol' Reliable" - the GM-EMD SD40, I will implement as much detail into each locomotive as I possibly can, based on all of the resources that are available to me.
   The idea with this project is, all you need to do is spawn this E2 on a locomotive body blank & this script will work its magick to bring your locomotive to life.
 * Feature Creep!
   What's a good project without feature creep? With Fantail, I'm doing everything possible to avoid feature creep. But, for this project... honestly, this one is way less serious (& far less safety conscious) than Fantail. So, this project can afford all the feature creep & bumblef*ckery one can throw at it.
   'Cause, it **is** Garrys Mod, after all. Even if GMTB is competing with (if not, better than) Train Simulator.
 * OpenControl compatible.
   This one is gonna be a bit of a challenging one, granted the interfaces aren't quite so universal as RLC. So, this one may not get implemented until a lot later on, down the track (pun intended).
 * Prop Spwaning.
   More specifically, your Engineer's Seat will automatically be spawned in your locomotive's cabin in a similar manner as to how this E2 script spawns in the bogeys.
   I will also have Smart Entity Discovery search for a parenting gate; automatically parent the seat to the gate; & the gate will automatically be parented to the locomotive's body. This should abstract away a lot of the heavy lifting that's required to get things moving. This is the main idea behind this project, after all.
   Another thing that will be done is your console(s), gauges & switches. They will all be fully functional & you will be able to interact with them in the ways that you can expect (IE from your Engineer's Seat).
 * RattleCan?
   Maybe. I ain't too familiar with RattleCan, as I prefer to do my own paint jobs. Apparently, RattleCan is quite the learning curve in & of itself. So, this one is also going into the "I'll cross that bridge when I get there" category.
 * RLC compatible.
   Yup! You read that right. This E2 script will eventually plug into Magnum MacKivler's Realistic Locomotive Controller, as this script will provide fully functional (as well as decorative) parts to your locomotive in an efficient manner.
 * Smart Entity Discovery - Make it a plugin!
   By doing this, it will make it even easier to implement Smart Entity Discovery into other projects as well as this one.
   Currently, Smart Entity Discovery is hard-coded into this E2 script. Because of that, it's not easily reusable in other stuff; & it's quite the headache to re-code every single time.
 * WireLink.
   Instead of having over9000 declared inputs & outputs, this E2 script will make extensive use of the WireLink protocol wherever possible.
