# GMTB Locomotive Detailing Script
I need to think of a better name for this project. Until I do, you're stuck with this one.

## Description:
 A locomotive detailing script for Garrys Mod Train Build.
 I also need to think of a way better description than that. It's a tad... blunt!

## Features:
 * Automatic updates.
   I took my Self-Updatable E2 script, made a plug-in version of it & added it to this script.
   So, whenever I update this project, your versions will get automatically updated too. Yay! =^/,..,^=
 * Multiplayer Lock.
   **NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH OR CONSTRUED AS DRM!** This is merely an anti-griefing measure, for when you're on a train build server.
   Basically, what this does is, it will hide the E2 chip itself & other folk won't be able to dick about with the script work in-server.
   If they want the source code, they can come & get it from here.

## What's next:
 * Details. Details **GALORE!**
   Over the years, I have been toying with Garrys Mod trains & Expression 2; & I think it's time that I start putting together my own public Expression 2 script, as my personal gift to the Garrys Mod Train Build community - Specifcally, the Flatgrass Construct & Northern Railroad. These folks have been absolutely wonderful in what they do, & I think that this is very well deserved.
   Starting off with "Ol' Reliable" - the GM-EMD SD40, I will implement as much detail into each locomotive as I possibly can, based on all of the resources that are available to me.
   The idea with this project is, all you need to do is spawn this E2 on a locomotive body blank & this script will work its magick to bring your locomotive to life.
 * RLC compatible.
   Yup! You read that right. This E2 script will eventually plug into Magnum MacKivler's Realistic Locomotive Controller, as this script will provide fully functional (as well as decorative) parts to your locomotive in an efficient manner.
 * OpenControl compatible.
   This one is gonna be a bit of a challenging one, granted the interfaces aren't quite so universal as RLC. So, this one may not get implemented until a lot later on, down the track (pun intended).
 * RattleCan?
   Maybe. I ain't too familiar with RattleCan, as I prefer to do my own paint jobs. Apparently, RattleCan is quite the learning curve in & of itself. So, this one is also going into the "I'll cross that bridge when I get there" category.
 * Feature Creep!
   What's a good project without feature creep? With Fantail, I'm doing everything possible to avoid feature creep. But, for this project... honestly, this one is way less serious (& far less safety conscious) than Fantail. So, this project can afford all the feature creep & bumblef*ckery one can throw at it.
   'Cause, it **is** Garrys Mod, after all. Even if GMTB is competing with (if not, better than) Train Simulator.
